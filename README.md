# Aero Connect - Team Repository

Welcome to the **Aero Connect** GitHub repository!

## About Us
Aero Connect is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of autonomous aerospace technology, with a special focus on improving disaster relief operations. 
Our mission is to create a platform that enhances the capabilities of drones and aircraft, enabling them to operate more effectively in crisis environments.

## Our Objectives
1. **Aerospace Autonomy Platform**: Develop and refine a platform for drone and aircraft manufacturers to adopt, increasing their vehicle capabilities.
2. **Crisis Response**: Focus on improving technologies to enhance response in disaster and emergency environments, ensuring quick, reliable, and safe operations.

## GoAERO Competition

Aero Connect was assembled to compete in the GoAERO Fly-Off competition, a challenge that tests the capabilities and innovation of teams in autonomous flight, efficiency, and disaster response systems. 
Our participation focuses on leveraging aerospace autonomy to solve real-world problems, particularly in the context of crisis management and disaster relief. 
We aim to develop solutions that enhance the performance and safety of drones and aircraft in critical environments, with the ultimate goal of advancing technology for global humanitarian aid.
